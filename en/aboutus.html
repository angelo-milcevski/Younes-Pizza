        <h3 class="pg-General-Kaushan au-Grid_SubTitle1">Our story</h3>
        <p class="au-Story au-Grid_Text1">
            The story begins way back in 1985, when Samir Sada, a native of Baghdad, Irak arrived to Aalborg, Denmark with his wife and his first son. Working with his father since he was 6 years old in their own bakery, he gained enough experience in the food industry domain, so that a few years later he opened his first restaurant, located in Aalborg. 
            
            During the next decade, his business changed many times so that he owned a few places, all with the same background. In 2000, after having some hard times, he managed to become the owner of the old and well-known Younes Grill & Pizza, the restaurant that he is still owning since then. Located in the city center of Aalborg, his pizzeria has provided their cherished customers with the most delicious food in a cozy and family-friendly environment. The local people attributes his growth to great food, service, customers and, of course, a wonderful team of his family.
